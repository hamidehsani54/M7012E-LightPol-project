HOW TO CONNECT TO THE SERVER:

connect to the IP of the server, connect to port 20276

The server will send a message to greet you:
>	send help

Authenticate by answering accordingly: (the message must at least start with this phrase)
>	no help

If you fail to authenticate, the connection will be terminated by the server.
If you are successfully authenticated, the server will send you the following message:
>	wtf

You must now identify yourself. There are 2 options here:
1. You are a sensor application that will send measurement data. Answer with the following:
>	sensor friend
2. You are a phone application that will send images and receive information. Answer with the following:
>	phone friend

After you have authenticated and identified yourself, you can freely communicate with the server.
There are a few command you can use here.

meas (sensor)
This sends measurements to the server.
This command follows the following structure:
>	meas x y z
x, y and z are integer numbers written as ascii characters.
Example usage:
>	meas 98 592 9

img (phone)
This sends an image to the server.
It follows the following structure:
>	img name.jpg;bytes
>	(file contents)
name can be any name containing letters and numbers, bytes is the number of bytes written as ascii characters.
file contents is just raw file contents as bytes. The number of bytes is defined above.
The server will wait for all contents to be received before reconstructing the image.
Maximum size is 25 megabytes (25000000 bytes).
Example usage:
>	img abc.jpg;90561
>	d0hasn0daKs]uidhoa089i<udhasDohaÃ…OJud (...) (90561 bytes in total, can be sent over multiple messages)
